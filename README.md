# Cab-Search-Web
***
The primary purpose of this project is to analyze the effects of different time(hour and month), weather and districts of Boston on cab usage and price to help tourists better understand Boston cab status. Also, we want to summarize the crime status for different period of time and districts of Boston, and we are trying to find potential relationship between the regional crime ratio and cab usage. In addition, we want to build a cab choice assistance to help tourists choose the most economic cab type and company based on their personal needs.
